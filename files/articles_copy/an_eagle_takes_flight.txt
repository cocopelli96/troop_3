It was 1:00 p.m., the sun was shining and the wind was blowing. The Scouts of Troop 12 Leominster gathered together at the Leominster Veteran’s Center. Why? Well none other than to celebrate Taylor T.’s Eagle Scout Court of Honor. It began with the scouts and leaders marching in. They spoke the honored words of the Pledge of Allegiance, Scout Oath, and Scout Law, led by Pat. Then Eagle Scouts Andy P., Ben B., and Ryan K. conveyed the symbolism of the Eagle throughout history from Ancient Rome and Egypt to the Kings and Queens of Europe to great symbol of the United States of America and finally to the highest rank in the Boy Scouts of America.

Soon Andy P., Ben B., and Ryan K. brought forth Taylor. Mr. Palladino had him take on a new task, and rededicate himself to Scouting. Andy P., Ben B., and Ryan K. brought forth his parents and Mr. Palladino had them give Taylor his medal and neckerchief. Taylor in turn gave each of them a pin. Then there were special presentations to Taylor and finally Taylor’s Speech. Part of the presentations was Taylor’s mom reading him a poem, however she started to cry and Mr. Johnson had to come up and help. Mr. Johnson had to borrow glasses to read the poem. Then he said he was going to cry as he read the poem and they had to read together. But, Mr. Johnson stopped reading and messed it up by talking. As the ceremony ended there was food for everyone to eat. Everyone gave Taylor their congratulations on achieving Scouting’s highest rank.
