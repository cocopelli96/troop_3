The clouds surrounded the landscape, thick, dark and cold as they let loose a torrent of snow which fell for two days. Finally, it felt like winter again. Just one day after the storm, the Scouts of Troop 12 Leominster were off on a winter expedition to Camp Split Rock, the mighty Cub Scout camp and home to the great Split Rock.

Friday night, cold and dark; the scouts arrived at the camp and began to move their gear in sleds down to the adirondacks. There they set up the half barrel for a fire and claimed four adirondacks. Once they were down a few scouts went sledding.

On Saturday the clouds once again came and opened a torrent of weather, but this time it was rain not snow. But even as it sprinkled the scouts had breakfast and prepared their lunches. The hike they had planned was canceled unfortunately. But three scouts and two adults left to the Pack 16 Pinewood Derby.

The scouts helped to sign in the cars, set up the track, race the cars down the track and take down the Pinewood Derby track. The leaders of Pack 16 were impressed and happy they got to sit back and watch their kidsâ€™ cars race. In fact, one of the siblings, a girl, had the fastest car. (They were all beaten by a girl.)

Those who stayed back at the campsite had gone sledding and played in the snow. Later that night they moved into the dining hall to dry and played cribbage. They packed up most the gear that Saturday night, and in the morning left nice and early.
