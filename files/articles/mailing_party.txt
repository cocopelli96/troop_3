It was a dark and starless night and there was a chill in the air. And yet six scouts and four Scoutmasters from Troop 12 Leominster ventured out to the cold council building. There they took part in various labors and ate pizza! They were met by few others who had journeyed out into the night as well.

They helped Camp Split Rock to prepare their brochures for mailing. They also helped to set up the Merit Badge Booklets for Merit Badge College. And they also got to help prepare some OA mailing before they departed. Those scouts and Scoutmasters learned some of the behind the scenes actions of the Boy Scouts of America and who did it. All in all they had a great time and so, satisfied with their work those six scouts and four Scoutmasters ventured back out into the cold quiet night to their homes.
